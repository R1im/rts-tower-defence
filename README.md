Browser Tower Defence
----------------------

You can find the live version of the game [hosted here](https://tsamb.github.io/rts). The hosted version is not always completely up to date with this repo. To play the bleeding edge, you can clone this repo and play it in a browser offline. Just open up index.html in your favourite browser (as long as your favourite browser is not IE).

### Overview

Goal: to build a real time strategy game in JavaScript.

Inspired in part by [Total Annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation). Thanks, [Chris Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_%28game_designer%29). And thanks [Dad](http://rurallaw.co.nz/team/partners/) for having epic TA battles with me for hours and hours on our LAN at home.
