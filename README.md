Goal: to build a real time strategy game in JavaScript.

Inspired in part by [Total Annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation). Thanks, [Chris Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_%28game_designer%29). And thanks [Dad](http://rurallaw.co.nz/team/partners/) for having epic TA battles with me for hours and hours on our LAN at home.
